# What?

This is an aggregation of tools related to the Tron AI Competition help by the Computer Science Club at the University of Waterloo.

This project could be used with [Tron server in a box](https://github.com/phillc/tron-server-in-a-box).

This is not meant to be a project where you pick a language, fork and go. Rather, this project is intended to leave breadcrumbs to figure out how to build your bot in any language. The ruby rake tasks should be enough to reverse engineer your way into figuring out how to get going in whatever language, and be able to use the two engines.

# Why?

This is a great way to get out there and learn new things, while facilitating trash talk in a team environment.

Perhaps you want to learn a new language, perhaps you want to further your understanding of a language, perhaps you want to try out functional programming, perhaps you want to further your understanding of many different theories in ai, graphs, etc., this is a great way to do it.

I am building this for me, because I need an excuse to learn a few new languages, and I am building this for those around me, because the more they improve, the more I improve.

# Requirements

* Ruby - if you want to use the rake tasks
* Python - if you want to use the python game engine
* Java - if you want to use the java game engine
* Your language of choice
